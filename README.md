# FinancialRiskProfileWebApp
Coding Language: HTML/CSS/PHP/Javascript  
Platform: Web  
Summary:  
This is a sample web app that was demo-ed to clients at Fortune 500 banks. The end product would be connected to a secure database.   
The purpose of this web app is for clients to view different regulatory risk statistics given a specific change in operations decisions (i.e. how would investing $50 million impact the LCR)

This was built to be connected to a MySQL database with client data. Since that data is private and sensitive I have taken all code relevant to the data out and have substituted with dummy variables. To see a screenshot of how it looks open the "screenshot.jpg" file.
